# SOLUTION.md

## Approach

I followed a modular structure using Vanilla JavaScript to create a responsive task management app. The app allows users to add, filter, complete, and delete tasks. All tasks are saved in localStorage.

## Trade-offs

- No external libraries were used.
- Editing tasks was not implemented due to time constraints.

## Features Implemented

- Add, delete, and mark tasks complete/incomplete
- Filter by status and priority
- Save/load tasks from localStorage
- Basic dark mode toggle
- Responsive and accessible HTML/CSS

## Setup

1. Unzip the folder
2. Run `make serve` or open `index.html` directly in a browser
